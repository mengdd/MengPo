Sina Weibo Client
This is a project created at Dec 1, 2013.



This project integrated sina weibo's sdk at that time. (Sorry about the loss of the SDK's version code).
This app can let user login by both username&password and SSO. (The later one is very convenient when you have the weibo client installed.)

The project is created under Eclipse, and now Android Studio is the trend.
When I import the project and run it again, the Auth exception pops out. 
So I have to admit the SDK is deprecated since now or maybe ealier. (21 July, 2015).
And I will work on a new repo to implement the app from new start. ^_^
